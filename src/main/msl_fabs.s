; MSL_DPMath_s_fabs.s -- Metrowerks Standard Library, statically linked into the ARM9.
;
; Not Game Freak code.  MSL and the CodeWarrior runtime own roughly 0x0208C000
; to 0x0209D850 of main; these bodies are pret/pokeheartgold's hand-matched
; lib/MSL_C/asm/MSL_DPMath_s_fabs.s, located in Black by tools/scripts/msl_sweep.py, which
; byte-searches every reference module for each MSL function with its
; relocation words masked.  Every function below is an exact hit.  The rest of
; the pret file is present in Black too but a few bytes different in each
; function -- Black links a slightly later build of the same library -- so it is
; deliberately not reproduced here.
;
; Branch targets and pool labels carry Black addresses, not pret's.
; Assemble: python tools/scripts/as.py src/main/msl_fabs.s
